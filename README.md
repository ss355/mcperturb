Mcperturb is a new multicollinearity diagnostic package. It uses small perturbation of noise to identify multicollinearity among continuous regressors of a multiple linear regression model. 
This package is developed using the statistical software package R and it includes the following documents:

1.	Data (Data.zip): The dataset and detailed notes about this dataset. 
2.	Mcperturb R code files (mcperturb.R.code.zip): It includes 18 R functions and one R script. Running this R script file can generate all figures and tables presented in the manuscript. 
3.	R Documentation or user manual (RDocumentation.pdf). This documentation includes detailed document for each R function, example code, and output results.
