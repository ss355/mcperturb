Mcperturb is a new multicollinearity diagnostic package. It uses small perturbation of noise to identify multicollinearity among continuous regressors of a multiple linear regression model. This package is developed using the statistical software package R. 

This mcpertrub github page includes the following documents:

1.	Data (Data.zip): The dataset and detailed notes about this dataset. 
2.	Mcperturb R code files (mcperturb.v1.0.zip): It includes 18 R functions and one README file. 
3.	R Documentation or user manual (R.Documentation.v1.0.pdf). This documentation includes detailed 
    document for each R function, example code, and output results. 
4.  Preproducible R scripts (Reproducible.R.Script.v1.0.R) to generate figures and tables presented in the manuscript and supplemental file
